The Mandalorian, AKA Din Djarin, is a feared and respected bounty hunter who has a reputation for being relentless in the pursuit of his targets. He is a skilled fighter and a master of hand-to-hand combat.

Grogu, AKA Baby Yoda, is a 50-year-old infant who was discovered by the Mandalorian. He has a strong connection to the Force and is being sought after by the Empire.
