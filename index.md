# About Me 

Hello, my name is <em><b>Laura</b></em>! I have created this webpage for a final project in my CTI 110 (Web, Programming, and Databases) class at Fayetteville Technical Community College (FTCC). I have really enjoyed this class! ðŸ˜Š I am currently studying Computer Programming & Development, as well as Geospatial Intelligence Studies.

My dream is to become a Computer Programmer and Web Developer. However, I'm very interested in many aspects of IT - including Data Science and Cybersecurity. 

I am from Raleigh, North Carolina, USA, and am a graduate of NC State University. Go Wolfpack!

<b>Interests</b>: Computer Technology, Fashion, Beauty (Makeup, Skincare), Current Events & Politics, Animals, Paranormal Topics, Podcasts, Documentaries/Movies/TV, singing, music, Belly Dancing, reading, shopping, and spending time with family and friends.

I have a pet Dachshund, "wiener dog", named Evelyn, and she is 11.5 years old! She is literally my child - that's how much I love her!

I had a pet Dachshund named Walter, but he passed away 2 years ago. He lived for 13.5 years & was a black-and-tan dog just like Evelyn. Walter had two major spinal injuries that caused him to lose most use of his hind legs. I bought him a little cart, AKA a doggie wheelchair, and he absolutely loved it! He lived his life as though he had no disability.

Last, but not least, my parents and I rescued a baby squirrel recently. His name is Mr. Nibbles AKA Superman. We tried to release him back into the wild, but he came back after 2 days!
